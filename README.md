# fighter-tracker
The UFC, and MMA in general, is overlooked by the mainstream sports media.
Although this has become less of a problem in the past few years, it is still hard to find reliable information. This project is a way to add your fighters and track them. I still need to add a bunch of features; such as: an alert that pops up when a UFC event is coming up, a table row that adds when a fighters next fight will be, a section that gives news updates, and more things I haven't thought of yet.
I learned a lot during this project. This was the first time I tried to do a number of these tasks.
Tasks like using a api and using bootstrap. I had some road blocks along the way but I feel that this project greatly improved my skills. I would have done a better job planning out my project in the beginning. I have never done a project like this before, so time management was an issue. It was hard to estimate how long tasks would take. I would have made my trello board differently. My api call works. The site looks decent. I spent all my time trying to get things to work and I got one
thing working so in all honesty I did not refactor much. I would like to eliminate the underscores in the weight class information. I would also like to add more features.
